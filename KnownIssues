1. When the number of states==1, there is an issue in Lyapunov recursive 
   (and Laplace recursive, in the calculation of d)  The size command
   on a tensor of size (1,1,1,1,1) will not give 5 as the length gets
   compressed and results in a (1,1) "matrix"

2. There is an internal feature in hjb that doubles the values of q and r
   This can be verified by feeding in an l(x,u) function with one set
   of values of q and r, then printing them out inside hjb.m just before
   the lqr2 function call. This avoid a divisions by 2 later on in the code. 

3. Need to add Schur-based change of variables in AlbrecktKronQQR.m
   for more meaningful linear system solve comparisons.  Since this was just
   a development crutch, further changes to this code aren't likely.

4. Add bilinear terms in the state and control objective
